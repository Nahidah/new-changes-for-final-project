            <h2>Chronological cv</h2>
            <p>Sometimes referred to as a traditional CV, a chronological CV is
                 one of the most common types of CV used by recent graduates. 
                 Presented in reverse chronological order it displays your most recent 
                 experience and achievements first.

            <h2>Functional cv</h2>
            <p>A functional CV emphasizes your skills as opposed to your work experience.
                 These CVs are best for job applicants who are recent graduates, lack industry experience, 
                 or are transferring to a different career. The functional CV highlights strengths, while
                  taking the focus off any employment gaps.

            <h2>Creative cv</h2>
            <p>A creative resume is a resume that doesn't follow the traditional resume templates. 
                These resumes are typically creative, catchy, and designed to showcase your skills 
                and qualifications in a way that plain words on paper can't. You can make one that 
                highlights your skills in a particular field.

            <h2>Academic cv</h2>
            <p>An academic CV is a document showcasing your teaching and research experience,
                publications, grants and fellowships, professional associations, awards and funding.
                It has to show all the details of your experience that show you're the best candidate
                for academic posts and research positions.
                <br>
                In the United States, you should never include a photo in an academic CV. It comes across as 
                somewhat inappropriate, like you are deliberately drawing attention to your appearance and 
                hoping it will influence the decision.
